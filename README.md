# Hacky-Art

At some point, this might evolve into an ssb client.

Usage:

- one-time setup:
  - clone this repository
  - run `npm install`
- starting the client
  - start patchwork, patchbay, or ssb-server etc
  - run `npm start`, this should open a web page
  - input the `~/.ssb/secret` file and click `Login`
  - enjoy the gallery of images
  - click on `Publish` to write your own image to the scuttleverse (warning: there's no preview step)
- inputting the secret file on a mac:
  - mac's finder windows will not show secret directories by default.  
  - to show them, when you have the file explorer window open, press `shift + option + .`
